# Metacognition in Agents

## Introduction 
This lesson will cover
* Introduction to metacognition 
* Planning in Agents
* Create Corrective RAG system
* Generate code as a tool


## Learning Goals 
After completing this lesson, you will have an understanding about: 
* Understand the implications of reasoning loop in agent definition 
* Use planning and evaluation techniques to help self correcting
* Create your own agents that is able to manipulate code to accomplish tasks

## Introduction to Metacognition
Metacognition refers to the higher-order cognitive processes that involve thinking about oneâ€™s own thinking. This will take our agent design to a deeper level as we now need a little bit more context.

We know that agents are defined as persona, tools and skills. That allows us to see an agent as an "expertise unit". But to move into Metacognition area we need the agent to take into account:
* Current task
* How to get to complete it
* Required resource to accomplish it
* Experience so far in dealing with such task

## Planning in agents

## Corrective RAG approach

### RAG as prompting technique vs tool

### Evaluating relevancy

### Search with intent

## Code generating agents

### Generating and executing code with Generative AI

### Using SQL as a RAG

### Solve problems with code
